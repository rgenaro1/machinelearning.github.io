# Startpage

## The History/Reasons of the project

This is a small project over 2 weeks created for 2 modules for my school:
* PRW3 (The API parts of the project)
* AWA1 (The animation and design of the project)
 
I had another startpage previously, downloaded from /wg/ and slightly modified but it had some bugs. So one year after I had the idea to create a new one that fits me.

My Old Homepage

My New Homepage

You can see the difference there, I think.

## The features in the new Homepage

### Left pannel

The left pannel show greetings and your current time and weather (editable)

### Mid pannel

The middle pannel show the search bar (customizable) and your favorites and also the CFF schedule called with the terminal

## Right pannel

The right pannel is where the terminal is and also the RSS flux pannel

# Customization

You can simply edit the parameters of the app inside the var.js file

# Soundcloud 

It's really simple to use it. There's a help inside the terminal.

[Get your custom app identification](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/)

This version requires you to login each time you want to use Soundcloud, it's because there's no need of a PHP server.

# How to use it ?

## The left pannel

The left pannel is pretty much self explained, there's no ambiguous way to use it because there's no way to actually use it.

## The mid pannel

### The search bar

Simply add "!<the letter>" to search something, if you don't put "!" you will search on the first searchengine.

### The bookmarks 

Just click on the link or the shortcut

## The right pannel

### Terminal

There's many command on the terminal, but you will use the "f <shortcut>" to open the bookmark wanted. Everything else is in the help of each fonction.

### RSS board

Simply click on the link to open the article

# Next version
I don't have any more ideas or maybe 1 or 2 like Riot Games api for games but I will see if I have the time to do it. So you can send me your recommendations inside the issues part of the project.
